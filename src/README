Internet DJ Console README.

A full set of documentation for this particular version can be
found in the doc directory of the source tree and possibly installed
in /usr/share/doc/idjc.../ in HTML format. Look for index.html.

The documentation on the project homepage at
http://idjc.sourceforge.net relates to the most recently released
source code tarball. It's advice may not be relevant to the version
you are trying to use.

If you obtained this code from the git repository the doc directory
won't exist yet. Please run the bootstrap script to re-create the
build environment and doc directory which is where to look for
further build instructions.

Before making IDJC itself you should install libshout-idjc from the
subdirectory of the git sources or separate download for the
released version. This probably only ever needs to be done once.
